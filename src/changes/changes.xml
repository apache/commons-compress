This file is also used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits. TBA how to use this with SVN.

        The tar package now allows the encoding of file names to be
        specified and can optionally use PAX extension headers to
        write non-ASCII file names.
        The stream classes now write (or expect to read) archives that
        use the platform's native encoding for file names.  Apache
        Commons Compress 1.3 used to strip everything but the lower
        eight bits of each character which effectively only worked for
        ASCII and ISO-8859-1 file names.
        This new default behavior is a breaking change.
