      <action type="fix" issue="COMPRESS-94" date="2010-01-07"
              due-to="Anon Devs">
        ZipArchiveEntry's equals method was broken for entries created
        with the String-arg constructor.  This lead to broken ZIP
        archives if two different entries had the same hash code.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" issue="COMPRESS-87" date="2009-10-30"
              due-to="Antoni Mylka">

        the archive was truncated.

      <action type="fix" issue="COMPRESS-86" date="2009-10-08">
        Tar archive entries holding the file name for names longer
        than 100 characters in GNU longfile mode didn't properly
        specify they'd be using the "oldgnu" extension.
      </action>
      <action type="add" date="2009-08-25">
        A new constructor of TarArchiveEntry can create entries with
        names that start with slashes - the default is to strip
        leading slashes in order to create relative path names.

        Delegate all read and write methods in GZip stream in order to
