/**
 * JUnit testcase for a multi-volume zip file.
 *
 * Some tools (like 7-zip) allow users to split a large archives into 'volumes'
 * with a given size to fit them into multiple cds, usb drives, or emails with
 * an attachment size limit. It's basically the same file split into chunks of
 * exactly 65536 bytes length. Concatenating volumes yields exactly the original
 * file. There is no mechanism in the ZIP algorithm to accommodate for this.
 * Before commons-compress used to enter an infinite loop on the last entry for
 * such a file. This test is intended to prove that this error doesn't occur
 * anymore. All entries but the last one are returned correctly, the last entry
 * yields an exception.
