   <body>
     <p>This page lists the known limitations and problems of Apache
     Commons Compress&#x2122; grouped by the archiving/compression
     format they apply to.</p>

     <section name="7Z">
       <ul>
         <li>the format requires the otherwise optional <a
         href="http://tukaani.org/xz/java.html">XZ for Java</a>
         library.</li>
         <li>only <code>File</code>s are supported as input/output,
         not streams. Starting with Compress 1.13
         <code>SeekableByteChannel</code> is supported as well.</li>
         <li>In Compress 1.7
         <code>ArchiveStreamFactory</code> will not auto-detect 7z
         archives, starting with 1.8 it will throw a
         <code>StreamingNotSupportedException</code> when reading from
         a 7z archive.</li>
         <li>Encryption, solid compression and header compression and
         are only supported when reading archives</li>
         <li>Commons Compress 1.12 and earlier didn't support writing
         LZMA.</li>
         <li>Several of the "methods" supported by 7z are not
         implemented in Compress.</li>
         <li>No support for multi-volume archives</li>
         <li>Support for some BCJ filters and the DELTA filter has
         been added with Compress 1.8.  Because of a known bug in
         version 1.4 of the <a
         href="http://tukaani.org/xz/java.html">XZ for Java</a>
         library, archives using BCJ filters will cause an
         <code>AssertionError</code> when read.  If you need support
         for BCJ filters you must use XZ for Java 1.5 or later.</li>
       </ul>
     </section>
     <section name="AR">
       <ul>
         <li>AR archives can not contain directories - this is a
         limitation of the format rather than one of Compress'
         implementation.</li>
         <li>file names longer than 16 characters are only fully
         supported using the BSD dialect, the GNU/SRV4 dialect is only
         supported when reading archives.</li>
       </ul>
     </section>
     <section name="ARJ">
       <ul>
         <li>read-only support</li>
         <li>no support for compression, encryption or multi-volume
         archives</li>
       </ul>
     </section>
     <section name="BZIP2">
       <p>Versions of Compress prior to 1.4.1 are vulnerable to a
       possible denial of service attack, see the <a

       <p>JAR archives are special ZIP archives, all limitations of <a
       href="#ZIP">ZIP</a> apply to JAR as well.</p>
       <ul>
         <li><code>ArchiveStreamFactory</code> cannot tell JAR
         archives from ZIP archives and will not auto-detect
         JARs.</li>
         <li>Compress doesn't provide special access to the archive's
         MANIFEST</li>

         was wrapped in a bufferng stream.</li>

     <section name="ZIP">
       <ul>
         <li><code>ZipArchiveInputStream</code> is limited and may
         even return false contents in some cases, use
         <code>ZipFile</code> whenever possible.  See <a
         href="zip.html#ZipArchiveInputStream_vs_ZipFile">the ZIP
         documentation page</a> for details.  This limitation is a
         result of streaming data vs using random access and not a
         limitation of Compress' specific implementation.</li>
         <li>only a subset of compression methods are supported,
         including the most common STORED and DEFLATEd.  IMPLODE,
         SHRINK and BZIP2 support is read-only.</li>
         <li>no support for encryption or multi-volume archives</li>
         <li>In versions prior to Compress 1.6
         <code>ZipArchiveEntries</code> read from an archive will
         contain non-zero millisecond values when using Java8 rather
         than the expected two-second granularity.</li>
         <li>Compress 1.7 has a known bug where the very first entry
         of an archive will not be read correctly by
         <code>ZipArchiveInputStream</code> if it used the STORED
         method.</li>
         <li><code>ZipArchiveEntry#getLastModifiedDate</code> uses
         <code>ZipEntry#getTime</code> under the covers which may
         return different times for the same archive when using
         different versions of Java.</li>
