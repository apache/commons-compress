        <section name="Apache Commons Compress&#x2122;">
            <p>
                The Apache Commons Compress library defines an API for
                working with ar, cpio, Unix dump, tar, zip, gzip, XZ, Pack200 and bzip2 files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The code in this component has many origins:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The bzip2, tar and zip support came from Avalon's
                Excalibur, but originally from Ant, as far as life in
                Apache goes. The tar package is originally Tim Endres'
                public domain package. The bzip2 package is based on
                the work done by Keiron Liddle as well as Julian Seward's
                <a href="http://www.bzip.org/index.html">libbzip2</a>.
                It has migrated
                via:<br/> Ant -&gt; Avalon-Excalibur -&gt; Commons-IO
                -&gt; Commons-Compress.</li>
              <li>The cpio package has been contributed by Michael Kuss
                and
                the <a href="http://jrpm.sourceforge.net/">jRPM</a>
                project.</li>
            </ul>
            <subsection name="Status">
              <ul>
                <li>The current release is 1.4.1.  This release fixes
                a denial of service flaw in
                <code>BZip2CompressorOutputStream</code> that is
                present in all earlier versions of Commons Compress.
                For details see the <a href="security.html">security
                reports page</a>.</li>
              </ul>

          <p>Commons Compress 1.4.1 requires Java 5.</p>
          
          <p>The compress component is split into <em>compressors</em> and
            <em>archivers</em>.  While <em>compressors</em>
            (un)compress streams that usually store a single
            entry, <em>archivers</em> deal with archives that contain
            structured content represented
            by <code>ArchiveEntry</code> instances which in turn
            usually correspond to single files or directories.</p>

          <p>Currently the bzip2, Pack200, XZ and gzip formats are
            supported as compressors where gzip support is mostly provided by
            the <code>java.util.zip</code> package and Pack200 support
            by the <code>java.util.jar</code> package of the Java
            class library.  XZ support is provided by the public
            domain <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/java.html">XZ for
            Java</a> library.</p>

          <p>The ar, cpio, dump, tar and zip formats are supported as
            archivers where the <a href="zip.html">zip</a>
            implementation provides capabilities that go beyond the
            features found in java.util.zip.  As of Commons Compress
            1.3 support for the dump format is read-only.</p>

          <p>The compress component provides abstract base classes for
            compressors and archivers together with factories that can
            be used to choose implementations by algorithm name.  In
            the case of input streams the factories can also be used
            to guess the format and provide the matching
            implementation.</p>
