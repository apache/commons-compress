                Commons Compress defines an API for working with ar,
                cpio, tar, zip, gzip and bzip2 files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The code in this component has many origins:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The bzip2, tar and zip support came from Avalon's
                Excalibur, but originally from Ant, as far as life in
                Apache goes. The tar package is originally Tim Endres'
                public domain package. The bzip2 package is based on
                the work done by Keiron Liddle.  It has migrated
                via:<br/> Ant -&gt; Avalon-Excalibur -&gt; Commons-IO
                -&gt; Commons-Compress.</li>
              <li>The cpio package has been contributed by Markus Kuss
                and
                the <a href="http://jrpm.sourceforge.net/">jRPM</a>
                project</li>.
            </ul>
            <subsection name="Status">
              <ul>
                <li>This component has been promoted to Commons proper</li>
                <li>The code has been released as version 1.0</li>
              </ul>

          <p>Commons Compress requires Java 1.4 or later.</p>
          
          <p>The compress component is split into <em>compressors</em> and
            <em>archivers</em>.  While <em>compressors</em>
            (un)compress streams that usually store a single
            entry, <em>archivers</em> deal with archives that contain
            structured content represented
            by <code>ArchiveEntry</code> instances which in turn
            usually correspond to single files or directories.</p>

          <p>Currently the bzip2 and gzip formats are supported as
            compressors where gzip support is provided by
            the <code>java.util.zip</code> package of the Java class
            library.</p>

          <p>The ar, cpio, tar and zip formats are supported as
            archivers where the <a href="zip.html">zip</a>
            implementation provides capabilities that go beyond the
            features found in java.util.zip.</p>

          <p>The compress component provides abstract base classes for
            compressors and archivers together with factories that can
            be used to choose implementations by algorithm name.  In
            the case of input streams the factories can also be used
            to guess the format and provide the matching
            implementation.</p>
