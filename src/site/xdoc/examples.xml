      <subsection name="Archivers and Compressors">
        <p>Commons Compress calls all formats that compress a single
        stream of data compressor formats while all formats that
        collect multiple entries inside a single (potentially
        compressed) archive are archiver formats.</p>

        <p>The compressor formats supported are gzip, bzip2, xz, lzma,
        Pack200, DEFLATE, Brotli, DEFLATE64, ZStandard and Z, the archiver formats are 7z, ar, arj,
        cpio, dump, tar and zip.  Pack200 is a special case as it can
        only compress JAR files.</p>

        <p>We currently only provide read support for arj,
        dump, Brotli, DEFLATE64 and Z.  arj can only read uncompressed archives, 7z can read
        archives with many compression and encryption algorithms
        supported by 7z but doesn't support encryption when writing
        archives.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Common Notes">
        <p>The stream classes all wrap around streams provided by the
          calling code and they work on them directly without any
          additional buffering.  On the other hand most of them will
          benefit from buffering so it is highly recommended that
          users wrap their stream
          in <code>Buffered<em>(In|Out)</em>putStream</code>s before
          using the Commons Compress API.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Factories">

        <p>Compress provides factory methods to create input/output
          streams based on the names of the compressor or archiver
          format as well as factory methods that try to guess the
          format of an input stream.</p>

        <p>To create a compressor writing to a given output by using
          the algorithm name:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
CompressorOutputStream gzippedOut = new CompressorStreamFactory()
    .createCompressorOutputStream(CompressorStreamFactory.GZIP, myOutputStream);
]]></source>

        <p>Make the factory guess the input format for a given
        archiver stream:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
ArchiveInputStream input = new ArchiveStreamFactory()
    .createArchiveInputStream(originalInput);
]]></source>

        <p>Make the factory guess the input format for a given
        compressor stream:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
CompressorInputStream input = new CompressorStreamFactory()
    .createCompressorInputStream(originalInput);
]]></source>

        <p>Note that there is no way to detect the lzma or Brotli formats so only
        the two-arg version of
        <code>createCompressorInputStream</code> can be used.  Prior
        to Compress 1.9 the .Z format hasn't been auto-detected
        either.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Unsupported Features">
        <p>Many of the supported formats have developed different
        dialects and extensions and some formats allow for features
        (not yet) supported by Commons Compress.</p>

        <p>The <code>ArchiveInputStream</code> class provides a method
        <code>canReadEntryData</code> that will return false if
        Commons Compress can detect that an archive uses a feature
        that is not supported by the current implementation.  If it
        returns false you should not try to read the entry but skip
        over it.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Concatenated Streams">
        <p>For the bzip2, gzip and xz formats a single compressed file
        may actually consist of several streams that will be
        concatenated by the command line utilities when decompressing
        them.  Starting with Commons Compress 1.4 the
        <code>*CompressorInputStream</code>s for these formats support
        concatenating streams as well, but they won't do so by
        default.  You must use the two-arg constructor and explicitly
        enable the support.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Restricting Memory Usage">
        <p>Starting with Compress 1.14
        <code>CompressorStreamFactory</code> has an optional
        constructor argument that can be used to set an upper limit of
        memory that may be used while decompressing or compressing a
        stream. As of 1.14 this setting only affects decompressing Z,
        XZ and LZMA compressed streams.</p>
        <p>For the Snappy and LZ4 formats the amount of memory used
        during compression is directly proportional to the window
        size.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="ar">

        <p>In addition to the information stored
          in <code>ArchiveEntry</code> a <code>ArArchiveEntry</code>
          stores information about the owner user and group as well as
          Unix permissions.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to an ar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ArArchiveEntry entry = new ArArchiveEntry(name, size);
arOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
arOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
arOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an ar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ArArchiveEntry entry = (ArArchiveEntry) arInput.getNextEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    arInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

        <p>Traditionally the AR format doesn't allow file names longer
          than 16 characters.  There are two variants that circumvent
          this limitation in different ways, the GNU/SRV4 and the BSD
          variant.  Commons Compress 1.0 to 1.2 can only read archives
          using the GNU/SRV4 variant, support for the BSD variant has
          been added in Commons Compress 1.3.  Commons Compress 1.3
          also optionally supports writing archives with file names
          longer than 16 characters using the BSD dialect, writing
          the SVR4/GNU dialect is not supported.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Version of Apache Commons Compress</th>
              <th>Support for Traditional AR Format</th>
              <th>Support for GNU/SRV4 Dialect</th>
              <th>Support for BSD Dialect</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>1.0 to 1.2</td>
              <td>read/write</td>
              <td>read</td>
              <td>-</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1.3 and later</td>
              <td>read/write</td>
              <td>read</td>
              <td>read/write</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>It is not possible to detect the end of an AR archive in a
        reliable way so <code>ArArchiveInputStream</code> will read
        until it reaches the end of the stream or fails to parse the
        stream's content as AR entries.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="cpio">

        <p>In addition to the information stored
          in <code>ArchiveEntry</code> a <code>CpioArchiveEntry</code>
          stores various attributes including information about the
          original owner and permissions.</p>

        <p>The cpio package supports the "new portable" as well as the
          "old" format of CPIO archives in their binary, ASCII and
          "with CRC" variants.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a cpio archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
CpioArchiveEntry entry = new CpioArchiveEntry(name, size);
cpioOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
cpioOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
cpioOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an cpio archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
CpioArchiveEntry entry = cpioInput.getNextCPIOEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    cpioInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

        <p>Traditionally CPIO archives are written in blocks of 512
        bytes - the block size is a configuration parameter of the
        <code>Cpio*Stream</code>'s constuctors.  Starting with version
        1.5 <code>CpioArchiveInputStream</code> will consume the
        padding written to fill the current block when the end of the
        archive is reached.  Unfortunately many CPIO implementations
        use larger block sizes so there may be more zero-byte padding
        left inside the original input stream after the archive has
        been consumed completely.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="dump">

        <p>In addition to the information stored
          in <code>ArchiveEntry</code> a <code>DumpArchiveEntry</code>
          stores various attributes including information about the
          original owner and permissions.</p>

        <p>As of Commons Compress 1.3 only dump archives using the
          new-fs format - this is the most common variant - are
          supported.  Right now this library supports uncompressed and
          ZLIB compressed archives and can not write archives at
          all.</p>

        <p>Reading entries from an dump archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
DumpArchiveEntry entry = dumpInput.getNextDumpEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    dumpInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

        <p>Prior to version 1.5 <code>DumpArchiveInputStream</code>
        would close the original input once it had read the last
        record.  Starting with version 1.5 it will not close the
        stream implicitly.</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="tar">

        <p>The TAR package has a <a href="tar.html">dedicated
            documentation page</a>.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a tar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
TarArchiveEntry entry = new TarArchiveEntry(name);
entry.setSize(size);
tarOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
tarOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
tarOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an tar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
TarArchiveEntry entry = tarInput.getNextTarEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    tarInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="zip">
        <p>The ZIP package has a <a href="zip.html">dedicated
            documentation page</a>.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a zip archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ZipArchiveEntry entry = new ZipArchiveEntry(name);
entry.setSize(size);
zipOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
zipOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
zipOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p><code>ZipArchiveOutputStream</code> can use some internal
          optimizations exploiting <code>SeekableByteChannel</code> if it
          knows it is writing to a seekable output rather than a non-seekable
          stream.  If you are writing to a file, you should use the
          constructor that accepts a <code>File</code> or
          <code>SeekableByteChannel</code> argument rather
          than the one using an <code>OutputStream</code> or the
          factory method in <code>ArchiveStreamFactory</code>.</p>

        <p>Reading entries from an zip archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ZipArchiveEntry entry = zipInput.getNextZipEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    zipInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an zip archive using the
          recommended <code>ZipFile</code> class:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ZipArchiveEntry entry = zipFile.getEntry(name);
InputStream content = zipFile.getInputStream(entry);
try {
    READ UNTIL content IS EXHAUSTED
} finally {
    content.close();
}
]]></source>

          <p>Reading entries from an in-memory zip archive using
              <code>SeekableInMemoryByteChannel</code> and <code>ZipFile</code> class:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
byte[] inputData; // zip archive contents
SeekableInMemoryByteChannel inMemoryByteChannel = new SeekableInMemoryByteChannel(inputData);
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(inMemoryByteChannel);
ZipArchiveEntry archiveEntry = zipFile.getEntry("entryName");
InputStream inputStream = zipFile.getInputStream(archiveEntry);
inputStream.read() // read data from the input stream
]]></source>

          <p>Creating a zip file with multiple threads:</p>

          A simple implementation to create a zip file might look like this:

<source>
public class ScatterSample {

  ParallelScatterZipCreator scatterZipCreator = new ParallelScatterZipCreator();
  ScatterZipOutputStream dirs = ScatterZipOutputStream.fileBased(File.createTempFile("scatter-dirs", "tmp"));

  public ScatterSample() throws IOException {
  }

  public void addEntry(ZipArchiveEntry zipArchiveEntry, InputStreamSupplier streamSupplier) throws IOException {
     if (zipArchiveEntry.isDirectory() &amp;&amp; !zipArchiveEntry.isUnixSymlink())
        dirs.addArchiveEntry(ZipArchiveEntryRequest.createZipArchiveEntryRequest(zipArchiveEntry, streamSupplier));
     else
        scatterZipCreator.addArchiveEntry( zipArchiveEntry, streamSupplier);
  }

  public void writeTo(ZipArchiveOutputStream zipArchiveOutputStream)
  throws IOException, ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
     dirs.writeTo(zipArchiveOutputStream);
     dirs.close();
     scatterZipCreator.writeTo(zipArchiveOutputStream);
  }
}
</source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="jar">
        <p>In general, JAR archives are ZIP files, so the JAR package
          supports all options provided by the ZIP package.</p>

        <p>To be interoperable JAR archives should always be created
          using the UTF-8 encoding for file names (which is the
          default).</p>

        <p>Archives created using <code>JarArchiveOutputStream</code>
          will implicitly add a <code>JarMarker</code> extra field to
          the very first archive entry of the archive which will make
          Solaris recognize them as Java archives and allows them to
          be used as executables.</p>

        <p>Note that <code>ArchiveStreamFactory</code> doesn't
          distinguish ZIP archives from JAR archives, so if you use
          the one-argument <code>createArchiveInputStream</code>
          method on a JAR archive, it will still return the more
          generic <code>ZipArchiveInputStream</code>.</p>

        <p>The <code>JarArchiveEntry</code> class contains fields for
          certificates and attributes that are planned to be supported
          in the future but are not supported as of Compress 1.0.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a jar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
JarArchiveEntry entry = new JarArchiveEntry(name, size);
entry.setSize(size);
jarOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
jarOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
jarOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

        <p>Reading entries from an jar archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
JarArchiveEntry entry = jarInput.getNextJarEntry();
byte[] content = new byte[entry.getSize()];
LOOP UNTIL entry.getSize() HAS BEEN READ {
    jarInput.read(content, offset, content.length - offset);
}
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="7z">

        <p>Note that Commons Compress currently only supports a subset
        of compression and encryption algorithms used for 7z archives.
        For writing only uncompressed entries, LZMA, LZMA2, BZIP2 and
        Deflate are supported - reading also supports
        AES-256/SHA-256 and DEFLATE64.</p>

        <p>Multipart archives are not supported at all.</p>

        <p>7z archives can use multiple compression and encryption
        methods as well as filters combined as a pipeline of methods
        for its entries.  Prior to Compress 1.8 you could only specify
        a single method when creating archives - reading archives
        using more than one method has been possible before.  Starting
        with Compress 1.8 it is possible to configure the full
        pipeline using the <code>setContentMethods</code> method of
        <code>SevenZOutputFile</code>.  Methods are specified in the
        order they appear inside the pipeline when creating the
        archive, you can also specify certain parameters for some of
        the methods - see the Javadocs of
        <code>SevenZMethodConfiguration</code> for details.</p>

        <p>When reading entries from an archive the
        <code>getContentMethods</code> method of
        <code>SevenZArchiveEntry</code> will properly represent the
        compression/encryption/filter methods but may fail to
        determine the configuration options used.  As of Compress 1.8
        only the dictionary size used for LZMA2 can be read.</p>

        <p>Currently solid compression - compressing multiple files
        as a single block to benefit from patterns repeating accross
        files - is only supported when reading archives.  This also
        means compression ratio will likely be worse when using
        Commons Compress compared to the native 7z executable.</p>

        <p>Reading or writing requires a
        <code>SeekableByteChannel</code> that will be obtained
        transparently when reading from or writing to a file. The
        class
        <code>org.apache.commons.compress.utils.SeekableInMemoryByteChannel</code>
        allows you to read from or write to an in-memory archive.</p>

        <p>Adding an entry to a 7z archive:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
SevenZOutputFile sevenZOutput = new SevenZOutputFile(file);
SevenZArchiveEntry entry = sevenZOutput.createArchiveEntry(fileToArchive, name);
sevenZOutput.putArchiveEntry(entry);
sevenZOutput.write(contentOfEntry);
sevenZOutput.closeArchiveEntry();
]]></source>

          certainly add exception handling and make sure all streams

SevenZArchiveEntry entry = sevenZFile.getNextEntry();

SevenZFile sevenZFile = new SevenZFile(inMemoryByteChannel);

        <code>IWORK_ARCHIVE</code> dialect can be used to parse IWA
        files that are part of Apple's iWork 13 format. If no dialect
        has been specified, <code>STANDARD</code> is used. Only the
