      <section name="Apache Commons Compress Security Vulnerabilities">
        <p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in
        released versions of Apache Commons Compress. Each
        vulnerability is given a security impact rating by the
        development team - please note that this rating may vary from
        platform to platform. We also list the versions of Commons
        Compress the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not
        been verified list the version with a question mark.</p>

        <p>Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you
        need to apply a source code patch, use the building
        instructions for the Commons Compress version that you are
        using.</p>

        <p>If you need help on building Commons Compress or other help
        on following the instructions to mitigate the known
        vulnerabilities listed here, please send your questions to the
        public <a href="mail-lists.html">Compress Users mailing
        list</a>.</p>

        <p>If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability
        or other unexpected behavior that has security impact, or if
        the descriptions here are incomplete, please report them
        privately to the Apache Security Team. Thank you.</p>

          href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12402">CVE-2019-12402</a></p>

          <p>The file name encoding algorithm used internally in Apache Commons
          Compress can get into an infinite loop when faced with specially
          crafted inputs. This can lead to a denial of service attack if an
          attacker can choose the file names inside of an archive created by
          Compress.</p>

          <p>This was fixed in revision <a
          href="https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=commons-compress.git;a=commitdiff;h=4ad5d80a6272e007f64a6ac66829ca189a8093b9;hp=16a0c84e84b93cc8c107b7ff3080bd11317ab581">4ad5d80a</a>.</p>

          2019 and made public on 27 August 2019.</p>

          href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11771">CVE-2018-11771</a></p>

          <p>When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read
          method of <code>ZipArchiveInputStream</code> can fail to
          return the correct EOF indication after the end of the
          stream has been reached. When combined with a
          <code>java.io.InputStreamReader</code> this can lead to an
          infinite stream, which can be used to mount a denial of
          service attack against services that use Compress' zip
          package</p>

          <p>This was fixed in revision <a

          <p>A specially crafted ZIP archive can be used to cause an
          infinite loop inside of Compress' extra field parser used by
          the <code>ZipFile</code> and
          <code>ZipArchiveInputStream</code> classes.  This can be
          used to mount a denial of service attack against services
          that use Compress' zip package.</p>

          href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2098">CVE-2012-2098</a></p>

          <p>The bzip2 compressing streams in Apache Commons Compress
          internally use sorting algorithms with unacceptable
          worst-case performance on very repetitive inputs.  A
          specially crafted input to Compress'
          <code>BZip2CompressorOutputStream</code> can be used to make
          the process spend a very long time while using up all
          available processing time effectively leading to a denial of
          service.</p>
