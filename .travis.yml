# Try to force to use the latest Java 11 instead of 11.0.2 to fix 
# https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212233

# Remove the outdated OpenJDK 11.0.2 which Travis image grabbed from java.net in
# https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/travis_jdk/files/install-jdk.sh#L200
# (which has 11.0.2 hard-coded!), and instead replace it with the latest openjdk-11-jdk-headless Ubuntu package.
# NB /usr/local/lib/jvm/openjdk11/bin is also on the PATH, but there's no need to change it (because we rm -rf anyway)
